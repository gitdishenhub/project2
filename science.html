  <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation(ISRO) is India's national space agency. It's headquarters is located at Bengaluru, Karnataka. ISRO's current chairman is S.Somanath. It was formerly known as the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR). It serves as the principal research and development arm of the Department of Space(DoS), overseen by the Prime Minister of India, with the Chairman of ISRO also serving as the chief executive of the DoS. It was set up in 1962 by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on the recommendation of scientist Vikram Sarabhai. It was renamed as ISRO in 1969 and was subsumed into the Departmaent of Atomic energy (DAE). The establishment of ISRO institutionalised space research activities in India. It has sent three missions to the Moon and one mission to Mars. It is primarily responsible for space-based operations, space exploration, international space coopertation and the development of related technologies. It operates the GAGAN (GPS-aided GEO augmented navigation) and IRNSS (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) satellite navigation systems. Modern space research in India can be traced to the 1920s, when scientist S.K Mitra conducted a series of experiments sounding the ionosphere through ground-based radio in Kolkata. Later, Indian scientists like C.V Raman and Meghnad Saha contributed to scientific principles applicable in space sciences. After 1945, important developments were made in coordinated space research by two scientists: Vikram Sarabhai, founder of the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad and Homi Bhabha, who established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. ISRO has three main primary spaceports: Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Kulasekarapattinam Spaceport, Thumba equatorial Rocket Launching Station. In 2003, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee urged scientists to develop technologies to land humans on the Moon and programmes for lunar, planetary and crewed missions were started. ISRO did not have an official logo until 2002.</p>

  <p>Geostationary weather satellites orbit the Earth above the equator. Because of this orbit, they remain stationary with respect to the rotating Earth and thus can record or transmit images of the entire hemisphere below continuously with their visible-light and infrared sensors. This is called Satellite technology. These satellites track things like atmospheric gases, sea levels and weather patterns. Satellite imagery is a critical ingredient in weather forecasting. The imagery provides a thorough look at large scale weather systems and their movement. In addition, small scale features such as thunderstorms or areas of fog can also be detected and monitored.</p>
  <p>Satellites provide synoptic observations of the natural disasters at regular intervals that helps in better planning and management of disasters. Satellites watch the Earth's weather very closely and can predict hurricanes, cyclones and other dangerous events with great accuracy. This real-time data helps authorities and communities prepare for and evacuate from disasters in a timely manner. Satellites track things like atmospheric gases, sea levels and weather patterns. This helps scientists understand climate change better, leading to more accurate predictions and informed decisions on how to deal with it. These satellites can play a big role in reducing the effects of climate change.</p>
  <p>Satellite Navigation is based on a global network of satellites that transmit radio signals from medium earth orbit. Users of Satellite Navigation are most familiar with the 31 Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites developed and operated by the United States. We know where they are because they constantly send out signals. A GPS receiver in your phone listens for these signals. Once the receiver calculates its distance from four or more GPS satellites, it can figure out where you are. Space probes are equipped with antennas that allow them to communicate with Earth. They send back data and images that are used by scientists.</p>
