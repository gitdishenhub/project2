<p><b>Trading:</b> People usually travelled to India for trading various types of goods since ancient times. During that period, India was the leading exporter of silk, cotton, sugar, precious stones etc. For centuries, India was the nexus of international trade by land and by sea. The valuable commodities exported from India included botanicals used as medicine, spices, dyes, unguents for rituals and worship and perfumes and cosmetics, as well as manufactured goods like dyed cottons and artificially colored stones. All these items were exported in exchange for gold and silver from other nations. Roman and Greek traders frequently traded with the ancient Tamil country, present day Southern India and Sri Lanka, securing trade with the sea faring Tamil states of the Pandyan, Chola and Chera dynasties and establishing trading settlements which secured trade with the Indian subcontinent by the Greco-Roman. In 17th century the Britain started to trade spices, clothes and indigo with the Indians.

<p>One of the most famous trade routes of India was the <b>Silk Route</b>. The Silk Route connected India to China, as well as the Roman Empire. Along with this, The Spice Route was a way of maritime trade. The <b>Salt Route</b>, <b>Incense Route</b>, <b>Tin Route</b>, and <b>The Amber Road</b> are few more examples of trade in Ancient India. In addition to West Asia, the Harappans also conducted business in Afghanistan and Central Asia through <b>Harappan Trade Routes</b>. This route is also known for connecting Harappans and the modern Mesopotamian towns. Kings of Mesopotamia boast that ships from Harappa carried lapis lazuli, carnelian, ivory, and gold to their cities.<br>
According to Ptolemy and Periplus, the ports on India's western and eastern seaboard were thriving. The most well-known was Barbaricum at the Indus River's mouth. In the Indo-Roman trade, it was significant. It was situated along the only navigable ancient Indian trade route. It is known that the merchants made a sizable profit from the ancient Indian trade route. According to Chinese literature Hou Han Shu, the most profitable course was Shentu and Rome. Until the middle of the second century CE, Kushanas ruled this region. Syrastrene (modern-day Surat) was the following significant port on the Gujarat coast. Barygaza was the most important port on the west coast. The Periplus on the Konkan coast refers to three ports: Chaul, Souppara, and Kalliene. The ports of northern Konkan were more significant due to prosperous agriculture. Also, its ancient Indian trade routes were well connected to its hinterlands. The Pandyas and Cholas ruled over the ports along the Coromandel coast. Amphorae, Arrentine pottery, Roman lamps, glass beads, and stone beads were discovered here. Kaveripattinam, which is mentioned in Sangam literature, was another well-known port.

<p><b>Religious study:</b> People also travelled to India in ancient times for studying about religion. For example, Xuanzang a Chinese scholar decided to come to India and stayed for almost 17 years during the reign of Harshavardhana in the seventh century (629 AD-645 AD) to learn the true teachings of Buddhist, collect Buddhist manuscripts to carry back to China and pay homage to the sacred places associated with Buddha. When he returned to China, he there translated the manuscripts he took back with him from Sanskrit into Chinese.<br>
Alberuni, a Persian scholar, visited India during the 11th century and extensively studied Indian culture, religion, and science. His work Kitab al-Hind provides a detailed analysis of Hindu philosophy, religious practices, astronomy, and mathematics.
