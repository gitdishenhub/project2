<b>Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar</b> was a great <b>Indian mathematician</b>. He made important contributions to <b>mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series and continued fractions</b> including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable. He is often regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results.

Ramanujan was born into a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family. His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar worked as a clerk in a sari shop. His mother, Komalatammal was a housewife and sang at a local temple. Since Ramanujan's father was at work most of the day, his mother took care of him as a child. He had a close relationship with her. From her, he learned about tradition and puranas. He learned to sing religious songs, to attend pujas at the temple and particular eating habits – all of which are part of Brahmin culture. On 1 October 1892, Ramanujan was enrolled at the local school. In November 1897, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time. By 14, he received merit certificates and academic awards which continued throughout his school career and he also assisted the school in the logistics of assigning its 1200 students (each with their own needs) to its 35-odd teachers. He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with infinite series. When he graduated from Town Higher Secondary School in 1904, Ramanujan was awarded the <b>K. Ranganatha Rao prize</b> for mathematics by the school's headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer. He received a scholarship to study at Government College in Kumbakonam, however, Ramanujan was so intent on studying mathematics that he could not focus on any other subjects and failed most of them, losing his scholarship in the process.</p>

Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902. In 1903, he tried to solve the quintic, not knowing that it was impossible to solve with radicals. In 1914, Ramanujan found a formula for infinite series. He had introduced the <b>Hardy-Ramanujan number</b> 1729. It is called so because it is the smallest number which can be expressed as the sum of two different cubes in two different ways. On 14 July 1909, Srinivasa Ramanujan married Janakiammal. Because of all his contributions to the Indian mathematics, the Prime Minister of India in 2012 (Manmohan Singh) had declared <b>National Mathematics Day</b> on 22 December to mark the birth anniversary of Srinivasa Ramanujan. Ramanujan spent nearly 5 years in Cambridge collaborating with G.H Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood. On 6 December 1917, he was elected to the <b>London Mathematical Society</b>. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1918, becoming the second Indian to do so, and he was the youngest Fellow in the entire history of the Royal Society. Recently, Ramanujan's formulae have found applications in crystallography and string theory. The Ramanujan Journal, an international publication, was launched to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by his work.<br>
Ramanujan was awarded a <b>Bachelor of Arts by Research Degree</b> (this degree was later renamed PhD) in March 1916 for his work on highly composite numbers, sections of the first part of which had been published the preceding year in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society. Ramanujan had numerous health problems throughout his life. His health worsened in England. He was also less resilient due to the difficulty of keeping to the strict dietary requirements of his religion there and because of First World War in 1914–18. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis and a severe vitamin deficiency, and was confined to a sanatorium. In 1919, Ramanujan returned to Kumbakonam, Madras Presidency, where he died in 1920 at the age of 32.
